Background: 
Patients requiring long-time medications often forget to take them on time, which in some cases, worsen their illnesses. Currently, most mobile applications on the market provides only the application user the ability to store their medicine schedule on a local device or in the cloud through creating accounts. Where all the tracking information are made private and no one other than the application users have access to these reminders.

Proposal:
In most cases, the patient’s family members or closest friends are also concerned about the patients and would like to be informed of the patients’ medication schedules. If we were to synchronize the user’s device data(e.g. patient info, medicine tracking history), then, the patient’s loved ones would be informed of the user’s medication schedules. Then they could remind the user to take action ideally by downloading our app from Google Play store and use the app’s features or by calling and texting the user.

Also considering the privacy of patient, the app/system would generate a random token to send to his/her family and friends to grant them access to the patient’s medical tracking information.
